# KKLTK: Kinyarwanda and Kirundi Languages ToolKit
KKLTK is a Python package for Kinyarwanda and Kirundi languages processing. KKLTK currently provides the sets of stopwords for both languages and other preprocessing tools such as Kinyarwanda and Kirundi tokenizers will be added soon. KKLTK requires Python 3.0, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8.

For more details information on how these stopwords were obtained, please refer to the paper to appear in [COLING 2020](https://coling2020.org/) titled  ["KINNEWS and KIRNEWS: Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Text Classification for Kinyarwanda and Kirundi"](https://github.com/Andrews2017/KINNEWS-and-KIRNEWS) by Rubungo Andre Niyongabo, Hong Qu, Julia Kreutzer, and Li Huang.
